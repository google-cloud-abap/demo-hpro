The MSDS/SDS provides critical information on the material's hazards, safe handling practices, PPE requirements, emergency response procedures, and disposal guidelines.\n• Storage:\n• Designated Areas: Store hazardous materials in designated areas specifically designed for their hazard class and compatibility. Separate incompatible materials to prevent dangerous reactions.\n• Flammable Storage Cabinets: Flammable liquids must be stored in approved flammable storage cabinets.\n• Segregation: Store incompatible hazardous materials in separate areas or use secondary containment to prevent accidental mixing. Refer to the compatibility chart provided in this guide for guidance on segregation requirements.\n• Ventilation: Ensure adequate ventilation in storage areas to prevent the buildup of flammable or toxic vapors. Regularly inspect and maintain ventilation systems to ensure they are functioning properly.\n• Handling:\n• Proper Techniques: Use appropriate equipment and techniques when handling hazardous materials.
