Prevent exposure to ignition sources, for example use non-sparking tools and\nexplosion-proof equipment. Potentially toxic/irritating fumes/vapour may be evolved from heated or agitated\nmaterial. Do not siphon by mouth. Use only with adequate ventilation. Do not use as a cleaning solvent or\nother non-motor fuel uses. For use as a motor fuel only. It is dangerous and/or unlawful to put petrol into\nunapproved containers. Do not fill container while it is in or on a vehicle. Static electricity may ignite vapour and\ncause fire. Place container on ground when filling and keep nozzle in contact with container. Do not use\nelectronic devices (including but not limited to cellular phones, computers, calculators, pagers or other\nelectronic devices etc) in or around any fuelling operation or storage area unless the devices are certified\nintrinsically safe by an approved national testing agency and to the safety standards required by national and/or\nlocal laws and regulations. Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard. Material can accumulate\nstatic charges which may cause an electrical spark (ignition source). Use proper bonding and/or ground\nprocedures. However, bonding and grounds may not eliminate the hazard from static accumulation. Consult\nlocal applicable standards for guidance.

A fixed sprinkler/deluge system is recommended. The type\nof container used to store the material may affect static accumulation and dissipation. Consistent with\nregulatory control requirements, storage and handling equipment and systems should be capable of preventing\nsoil and groundwater contamination by liquid spills and vapor emissions. Leak detection systems and programs\nare recommended. Keep container closed. Handle containers with care. Open slowly in order to control\npossible pressure release. Store in a cool, well-ventilated area. Outside or detached storage preferred.\nKeep away from incompatible materials. Storage containers should be earthed and bonded. Fixed storage\ncontainers, transfer containers and associated equipment should be earthed and bonded to prevent\naccumulation of static charge.","REVISED_CONTENT":"Product ID:HZ-GAS,Product Description:Gasoline,Storage Location:0001,Storage Location Description:Lager 0001,Plant:0001,Section Id:7,Section Header:Handling and storage,Section Content:HANDLING\nAvoid all personal contact.
