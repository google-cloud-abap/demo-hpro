Extinguishing Media\nSuitable Extinguishing Media: Use fire extinguisher with class B rating.\nUnsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use direct water on the burning/molten product; they could cause a steam explosion and\nspread of the fire.\n5.2.\nSpecial Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture\nFire Hazard: Flammable solid with a relatively low ignition temperature. Sulfur dust ignites easily in air. Grinding sulfur may produce\nan explosion hazard. Static discharge may ignite sulfur dust.\nSulfur burns with a pale blue flame that may be difficult to see in daylight. Burning sulfur will flow and emits large quantities of\nsulfur dioxide, a toxic, irritating and suffocating gas that can cause severe lung damage and death.\nMolten sulfur may evolve hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is a flammable gas and may present an explosion hazard in a confined\nspace. Under certain conditions, hydrogen sulfide can react to form pyrophoric iron compounds in enclosed spaces, such as sulfur\npits.\nExplosion Hazard: May form flammable/explosive vapor-air mixture. Combustible materials/Substances liable to spontaneous\ncombustion.\nReactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.\n5.3. Advice for Firefighters\nPrecautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire. Under fire conditions, hazardous fumes will be\npresent.\nFirefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.\nProtection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.\nHazardous Combustion Products: Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, smoke, fumes, unburned hydrocarbons and oxides of sulfur\nand/or nitrogen. Hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur-containing gases can evolve from this product particularly at elevated\ntemperatures.\nOther Information: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water courses.\nReference to Other Sections\nRefer to Section 9 for flammability properties.","REVISED_CONTENT":"Product ID:HZ-SUL,Product Description:Sulfur,Storage Location:0001,Storage Location Description:Lager 0001,Plant:0001,Section Id:5,Section Header:Fire-fighting measures,Section Content:5.1.
