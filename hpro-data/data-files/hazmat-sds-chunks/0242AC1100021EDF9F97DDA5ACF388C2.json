Precautions for Safe Handling\nAdditional Hazards When Processed: Handle empty containers with care because residual vapors are flammable. Avoid dust\nproduction. Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product. Do not pressurize, cut, or weld containers.

Hydrogen sulfide is a\ntoxig gas that can be fatal. It also has a rotten egg smell that causes odor fatigue very quickly and should not be used as an indicator\nfor the presence of gas.\nHygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities\nTechnical Measures: Prevent build-up of electrostatic charges (e.g, by grounding).
